# Travel Agency Services Architecture

This project represents a service-oriented architecture for a travel agency called "Travel Global". The architecture comprises several components that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for booking and managing travel services.

## Components

1. **BookingBack**: This service handles the booking-related functionality, such as creating, updating, and retrieving bookings.

2. **ClientesBack**: This service manages client-related data, including client profiles, preferences, and past bookings.

3. **Gateway**: The Gateway service acts as the entry point for the application, routing requests to the appropriate backend services and handling cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, and logging.

4. **NotificationBack**: This service is responsible for sending notifications to clients, such as confirmation emails, itinerary updates, and reminders.

5. **eureka-server**: The Eureka server is a service discovery mechanism that allows the individual services to discover and communicate with each other.

## Architecture Overview

The Travel Global application follows a service-oriented architecture (SOA) approach, where each component is a standalone service with its own responsibilities and data. This approach provides several benefits, including:

1. **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on its specific resource requirements, allowing the system to handle increasing workloads.

2. **Flexibility**: The modular design of the architecture makes it easier to update, replace, or add new services without affecting the entire system.

3. **Reliability**: If one service fails, the other services can continue to function, ensuring a more resilient system.

4. **Maintainability**: The separation of concerns and clear boundaries between services simplify the development, deployment, and maintenance processes.

5. **Interoperability**: The services communicate with each other using well-defined interfaces, enabling integration with other systems or third-party services.

The Eureka server plays a crucial role in this architecture, allowing the individual services to discover and communicate with each other seamlessly. The Gateway service acts as the entry point, handling client requests, authenticating users, and routing requests to the appropriate backend services.

## Usage

To use the Travel Global application, clients can interact with the Gateway service, which will then delegate the requests to the appropriate backend services. The backend services will handle the business logic and data management, with the Eureka server facilitating the communication between the services.
